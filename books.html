    <div class="myDIV"> <h3>China Room - Sunjeev Sahota.</h3></div>
    <div class="hide"><img src="img/chinaroom.webp"></div>
<i>left wondering if it was based on a true story, or was non-fiction. 
    not sure how to really feel about it, handles addiction well, not quite as sure about the child brides.

    <div class="myDIV"> <h3>Notes on an Execution - Danya Kukafka.</h3></div>
    <div class="hide"><img src="img/notes.jpg"></div>
<i>absolutely devoured this book in (almost) one session. so good, beautifully written and tackles the subjet matter with such integrity and nuance. 
    <br> Brought to tears on many many instances, cried through the last 50-100 pages, but really just breezed through the content. amazing.

        <div class="myDIV"> <h3>Finna - Nino Cipri</h3></div>
        <div class="hide"><img src="img/finna.jpg"></div>
    <i>eh! luckily it was a novella, otherwise i'm not sure it would have held my interest for that long. it's interesting seeing diversity in books,
        but there's something about presenting it in such a relevant, millennial way that makes it feels forced or artificial. of course a nonbinary character
        would have to deal with their boss misgendering them, and of course the mc has depression and anxiety, but somehow putting it all out there 
        makes it feels unnatural. maybe it's too real. maybe it's too anchored in reality (ironic considering it has wormholes and alternate dimensions 
        of ikea). i'd say what i found weird about the book is that's probably aimed more towards a ya audience, as at moments it did remind me of the ya 
        book i accidentally started reading. there's something just too obvious about it, no matter where the story goes. it does have poetic moments near the end,
        and we obviously see character growth in everyone involved, but there's something very lifeless and soulless about the book. sorry! might check out the sequel in the future.

        <div class="myDIV"> <h3>Baby Teeth - Zoje Stage</h3></div>
        <div class="hide"><img src="img/babyteeth.jpg"></div>
    <i>boy, what a pain in the ass! <Br> so long, so not worth the wait. i'm very confused about what this is trying to say about 
        mental health or children or parents or white people. maybe it's just a dumb story, but it feels like 
        it's going a true crime route and is definitely villanizing aspd. wasn't bothered by the kid's voice 
        and i could very well believe everything that happened, but just not worth the read.

    <i> so fucking boring. maybe it gets better but i couldn't get past the first couple of chapters. horrible choice 
        after dealing with the child's perspective in babyteeth. turned me off books for the rest of the month
